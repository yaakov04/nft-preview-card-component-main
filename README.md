## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- Vim (my first time using, it was hard)

### What I learned

With this small challenge, besides reinforcing my knowledge in HTML and CSS, I put in practice the methodology BEM; methodology especially useful in the creation of reusable components. As an additional challenge I proposed use only Vim.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about:
- CSS animations
- Javascript frameworks (Vue and React) 

### Useful resources

- [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) - The documentation to use BEM
- [A guide of Vim](https://platzi.com/tutoriales/1748-terminal/6324-guia-para-usar-el-editor-de-texto-vim/) - The guide was very useful when I using Vim
